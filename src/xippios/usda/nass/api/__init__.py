"""Endpoint wrappers for USDA NASS Quick Stats.

Layer 1 of ADR-0001: one module per upstream operation, named after it. A wrapper
takes the parameters as upstream names them (snake_cased), calls
``xippios.usda.nass._client.client`` and returns models from ``models.py`` that
mirror the payload. No composition and no defaults beyond upstream's own. The reference
is the snapshot in ``docs/upstream/``.
