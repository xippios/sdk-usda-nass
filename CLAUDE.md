# sdk-usda-nass — instructions for Claude Code

`xippios-usda-nass` wraps USDA NASS Quick Stats as a typed Python client, an MCP server
and FastAPI routes, built on `xippios-core`. This file is the contract for every session
that works here; the family rules it points to apply as well.

## What this package wraps

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Upstream | USDA NASS Quick Stats, https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov |
| API base URL | `https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api` |
| Documentation | https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api, snapshotted in `docs/upstream/` |
| Credentials | `NASS_API_KEY` from the environment, sent as the `key` query parameter |
| Rate limit | 30 requests per minute, burst 1; a self-imposed pace, upstream documents none (ADR-0010); enforced client-side in `_client.py` |
| Write tools | no, this package is read-only |

The snapshot in `docs/upstream/` is the reference for names, parameters and semantics.
If it is empty or stale, run `/refresh-upstream` first and review the diff. Never write a
wrapper from memory of the API.

## Read first, in this order

1. `docs/upstream/FETCHED.md` and the files it lists: what the upstream actually offers
2. The family conventions: `../sdk-core/docs/conventions.md` and `../sdk-core/docs/adr/`
   (also at https://github.com/xippios/sdk-core/tree/main/docs)
3. `../sdk-core/docs/definition-of-done.md`: what a PR must satisfy
4. The family file `../CLAUDE.md`
5. When a new core minor or template release comes: conventions §15, the adoption
   checklist, which `/adopt-release` walks

## The one rule: three layers (ADR-0001)

```
api/<operation>.py   one async function per upstream operation, upstream names, returns models
tasks.py             the public API: composes wrappers, returns Result[T], sync facade via sync()
mcp.py  http.py      adapters: register tasks.__all__, nothing else. Never edited to add an endpoint.
```

Adapters call only task functions. Tasks call only endpoint wrappers and reference
data. If logic appears in `mcp.py` or `http.py`, it belongs in `tasks.py`.

## Layout

```
src/xippios/usda/nass/
  __init__.py      public surface: __version__ and re-exported task functions
  py.typed         PEP 561 marker; consumers' mypy --strict needs it
  _version.py      __version__ from distribution metadata
  _client.py       the one configured AsyncClient (base URL, key, rate limit)
  models.py        pydantic models mirroring upstream payloads (UpstreamModel)
  api/             endpoint wrappers, one module per upstream operation
  tasks.py         task functions; __all__ is what the adapters register, MCP_CAPS any
                   per-tool result caps
  mcp.py           xippios-usda-nass-mcp entry point
  http.py          FastAPI router
  params.py        packaged value lists: PACKAGED_LISTS, packaged_values()
  enums.py         StrEnums (IntEnums for integer ids) generated from the packaged lists;
                   never edited by hand
  reference/       packaged code lists (CSV/JSON) plus README with provenance
scripts/
  refresh_reference.py   fetches the packaged lists through api/ and regenerates enums.py
tests/
  conftest.py      enables xippios.core.testing.plugin, which keeps the run offline
  fixtures/        recorded responses, <endpoint>/<case>.json, never hand-written
  test_tasks.py    structural checks on every task plus per-task replay tests
  test_adapters.py the adapters expose exactly tasks.__all__
  test_layout.py   namespace levels stay empty; py.typed ships
  test_live.py     @pytest.mark.live smoke tests, one per task
docs/upstream/     documentation snapshot and FETCHED.md
.github/workflows/ ci.yml (the required ci check), publish.yml (tag to PyPI), live.yml (nightly live tests)
.claude/commands/  add-endpoint, record-fixture, refresh-upstream, refresh-reference-data, release-prep,
                   adopt-release
```

`src/xippios/` has **no** `__init__.py`: it is a PEP 420 namespace package shared with
`xippios-core` and every other source package, and so is every level
between it and the package (`src/xippios/usda/`).
Never add one; `tests/test_layout.py` fails if it appears. The import path is
`xippios.usda.nass` (ADR-0006).

## How to add an endpoint

Run `/add-endpoint <upstream operation>`. In short:

1. Read the operation in `docs/upstream/`. Names, parameters and semantics come from
   there, snake_cased, nothing renamed, nothing normalised across sources.
2. `models.py`: an `UpstreamModel` per payload object; dates, numbers and enums typed.
3. `api/<operation>.py`: one async wrapper that calls `_client.client` and returns
   models through `xippios.core.parse`.
4. `tasks.py`: an async task that composes wrappers and returns `Result[T]` with full
   `ResultMeta` (source, endpoint, request parameters, `published_at`/`vintage` when the
   upstream gives them). Derive the sync one with `sync()`, add its name to `__all__`,
   re-export it from `__init__.py`. What it returns leaves out documented personal
   identifiers (`ssn`, `iban` and their like) unless it fetches them deliberately and
   says so, and a write task does not echo one in `meta.request` (ADR-0017).
5. Docstring for agents: one sentence, then `Args:` with examples of valid values for
   every parameter. The MCP tool description and the OpenAPI summary come from it.
6. `/record-fixture` for at least one case, a replay test in `test_tasks.py` that also
   calls the tool end to end with `xippios.core.testing.mcp_call` (and compares what was
   sent through `sent_urls(route)`, never a request from `route.calls`), a live smoke test
   in `test_live.py`.
7. `CHANGELOG.md` under Unreleased, README status table, then the full check suite.

Reference lookups (commodities, countries, attributes) are tasks too, named
`list_<thing>`, so agents can form valid calls; one whose whole list an agent needs and
the default result cap (200 rows or 64 KB) would cut gets a cap of its own in `MCP_CAPS`
in `tasks.py`, which `mcp.py` passes through (ADR-0016). A task-shaped function that returns a
subset of an upstream record builds its model with `UpstreamModel.project`; nothing is
renamed or computed, parsing a value (`parse_decimal`) is the only override. Upstream's
documented error shapes go into `ClientConfig.classify` in `_client.py`, once; wrappers
use `client.get_json` and never inspect status codes. An upstream that reports an hourly
or daily quota gets one `QuotaPolicy` installed on `config` there, as the commented block
in `_client.py` shows, and `classify` maps its answer to a spent quota to
`RateLimitError` with `retry_after` (ADR-0010, ADR-0015).

## How to record a fixture

Run `/record-fixture <endpoint> <case> <parameters>`. It performs one live request
through the real client with `xippios.core.testing.record_sync` and writes
`tests/fixtures/<endpoint>/<case>.json` with credentials scrubbed. Grep the file for
key patterns, and for the personal identifiers the package keeps out of its projections
(ADR-0017), before committing. Fixtures are never typed in by hand.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
uv run pytest                      # offline, replays fixtures
uv run pytest -m live              # needs XIPPIOS_LIVE_TESTS=1 and NASS_API_KEY
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
uv run xippios-usda-nass-mcp   # stdio; add --http for streamable HTTP
```

The offline run is core's plugin's (ADR-0013): in every test not marked `live` it refuses
the network and skips the rate limiter's waits, and the key sent is its placeholder,
with `NASS_API_KEY` set to it because `pyproject.toml` names that variable under
`xippios_placeholder_key_envs`; the package keeps no placeholder fixture of its own.
A test that asserts a limiter wait or a quota pause is marked `rate_limited`, one that
must reach the network `network`.

`.github/workflows/live.yml` runs `uv run pytest -m live` with `XIPPIOS_LIVE_TESTS=1`
nightly at 01:51 UTC, a time derived from the slug so that sources sharing a key never
start together, and on demand from the Actions tab; pull requests never run live tests.
Only its `uv run pytest -m live` step sees the key, from the org secret `NASS_API_KEY`.

## Workflow rules

- Branch from `main` as `feature/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>`, `chore/<topic>` or `docs/<topic>`.
  Never commit to `main`.
- Commit small, with Conventional Commits messages (`feat(tasks): add get_balance_sheet`).
- Open the PR with `gh pr create`; the body is the definition-of-done checklist from
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, ticked honestly, with assumptions listed.
- `ruff` leaves `docs/` alone; never reformat the upstream snapshot.
- Template and core updates: a new sdk-template release, and the core minor it carries,
  arrive in one adoption PR, `chore/template-update-<tag>`, before the next release
  (conventions §15); `/adopt-release <tag>` walks it, and it auto-merges after the
  reviewer's `ready`. `uvx copier update` re-renders the files the template owns
  (`tests/conftest.py`, `tests/test_layout.py` and `tests/test_adapters.py` among them;
  answers are in `.copier-answers.yml`) and never overwrites the files this package fills:
  `__init__.py`, `_client.py`, `models.py`, `api/`, `tasks.py`, `tasks_write.py`,
  `params.py`, `enums.py`, `reference/`, `scripts/`, `tests/test_tasks.py`,
  `tests/test_tasks_write.py`, `tests/test_live.py`, `tests/fixtures/`, `docs/upstream/`,
  `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. Template changes to those are listed per release under
  "Hand-apply" in sdk-template's
  [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/xippios/sdk-template/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md); port them
  by hand in the same PR.
- If a convention seems wrong, say so in the PR and follow it anyway; changing it is a
  PR against `sdk-core/docs/conventions.md` plus an ADR.

## Never

- Never hand-write a fixture, and never commit one without grepping for key patterns.
- Never read or print `.envrc`, `.env`, or any variable ending in `_API_KEY`.
- Never write a key into a file or a commit.
- Never put logic in `mcp.py` or `http.py`; never add a route or tool by hand.
- Never rename or re-map an upstream concept to another source's (ADR-0003).
- Never return a documented personal identifier in a task's projection, echo one in
  `meta.request`, or commit one in a fixture (ADR-0017).
- Never edit `docs/upstream/` by hand; `/refresh-upstream` fetches, a PR reviews.
- Never add `src/xippios/__init__.py` or `src/xippios/usda/__init__.py`, the provider level.
- Never tag, merge, release, force-push, or touch `gh secret`. Those are human actions;
  the one exception is enabling auto-merge on a `chore/template-update*` or
  `chore/release-*` PR after the reviewer's `ready` (ADR-0018).

## When something is unclear

Prefer the smallest change that satisfies the documents above, state the assumption in
the PR description, and stop rather than guess at upstream semantics or public API shape.
